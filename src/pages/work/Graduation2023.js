      <div className='description'>Graduation is a cut-off of a 6-year project, Blackbox Pages, dating back to 2017. Over the course, this project served as platform to allow writers, designers, videographers, photographers, models, and artists to <span className='emphasis'>problem solve in a space that presented an idea to be executed</span>. These ideas strung together in a series all costumed as a current-day brand. This <span className='emphasis'> playground </span> gave each individual the infrastructure to have a hand beyond their discipline in experiences that are common in the industry. From marketing rollouts, show production, and portfolio building to written communication and contract management, Blackbox Pages provided members with an opportunity to hone in on their skills, experiment with new domains, work with other artists in the DFW area, and provided the ethics to navigate in a professional setting.</div>
